# Project A Game Documentation
"Project A" is a development game that relies on logic and creating building blocks for future projects. Project A will try to avoid animations, especially in character, as this can be a big constraint since we don't have any animation or rigging experience. For the time being, this project will have many interactive objects and module objects to play with.

# What's our end goal
Our end goal should be able to gather materials from environmental and craft items. Player will be able to go into a random-generated dungeon and find new materials and fight monsters. Going further into the dungeon, rare material will appear more frequently and monster will become more aggressive and stronger. Player will have the option to head out anytime. As player level up, they will have the ability to upgrade their skills to have strong fire power and different types of projectiles to use from. Player will have a main map for the player to roam and prepare their gear. In the future, the player can then build their own house, farms, and other ideas to make their place will unique.
